/**
 * Dispatches alert emails to every eligible watcher of the entity an
 * activity event just landed on. Hooked into `recordActivitySafely` (see
 * spec §5) so all 21 instrumented action handlers get watch alerts for
 * free, with zero per-action wiring.
 *
 * Semantics (spec §5, followed exactly):
 *   1. Skip immediately when there's no concrete entity to watch
 *      (`entityId === null`) or in demo mode (demo never sends real email
 *      and never mutates `last_notified_at`).
 *   2. One indexed SELECT on (orgId, entityType, entityId) with the
 *      cooldown predicate baked in (`last_notified_at` NULL or older than
 *      `WATCH_COOLDOWN_MS`), capped at `WATCH_NOTIFY_CAP` rows.
 *   3. Per watch, send a plain-text alert built by the pure
 *      `buildAlertEmail`.
 *   4. Only a live, non-simulated send consumes the cooldown — a
 *      simulated send (keyless/demo/build env) must NOT update
 *      `last_notified_at`, or a due watcher could silently miss its real
 *      alert once a live key is configured.
 *   5. The entire body runs under one try/catch: any failure (a bad
 *      query, a rejected `sendEmail` call, anything) is Sentry-tagged and
 *      swallowed. This function can NEVER throw — audits and business
 *      logic must never be blocked by notification failures.
 *
 * PII discipline: no recipient address, subject, or body text ever
 * reaches a Sentry tag — only the fixed `feature`/`subStep` attribution.
